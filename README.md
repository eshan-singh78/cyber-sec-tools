# Cybersecurity Tool Stash & Experimentation

Welcome to my personal stash of cybersecurity scripts and tools! This repository is a collection of various cybersecurity-related scripts, tools, and experimentation projects. It serves as a space for testing, developing, and improving tools that can aid in penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and other security-related tasks.

## âš¡ Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as:

- A **tool stash** for various cybersecurity scripts and utilities I've created or modified.
- An **experiment zone** where I test different approaches to security challenges.
- A **learning space** for improving my knowledge of cybersecurity, scripting, and automating tasks.

> **Note**: These scripts are meant for educational and research purposes only. Please ensure you have proper authorization before using any of the tools on systems you do not own.

## ðŸš€ What's Inside

You'll find the following types of tools and scripts here:

- **Penetration Testing Tools**: Scripts for testing web apps, network security, and system vulnerabilities.
- **Automation Scripts**: Scripts that automate routine security tasks like port scanning, recon, or brute force testing.
- **Custom Exploits**: Experimentation with vulnerability exploitation.
- **Miscellaneous Tools**: Other handy utilities for managing security tasks.

Each script or tool is contained along with any relevant documentation, dependencies, or setup instructions.
